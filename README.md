# Whiteboard
Java whiteboard application with networking capabilities.

Functionality: 
- Connect with multiple clients over a network and work on the same whiteboard.
- Add, remove, resize, and recolor basic shapes like squares on a whiteboard.
- Add text.
- Ability to move objects to front, to back, etc.
- Ability to save whiteboard state to a .png file.

Things that need to be worked on:
- Resizing/moving Oval
- Resizing/moving line
- Resizing/moving text box
- Table information

To try networking capabilities. Run a whiteboard.jar "start server". Start another whiteboard.jar
and "start client". If they are running under same port it will work. Server and client sync
instantly.
